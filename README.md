# Bidly
Bidly is an innovative platform that connects homeowners directly with local trade persons, allowing them to bid on posted projects. 
This project was brought to life by [Vanessa Wing√•rdh](https://github.com/vwingardh) and [Ibrahim Iqbal](https://github.com/dIB59) during a two-week project at SALT.

## Overview
Traditionally, when homeowners needed to install something as simple as recessed lights, they would have to engage with a commercial company. This often resulted in higher costs and less personalized service. We thought, "What if there was a way to connect with a local electrician for a quote?" Enter Bidly.

In contrast to platforms like Fiverr, which enable users to advertise their skills for hire, Bidly is designed to serve those needing tasks done. Our application fills a void in the market by serving as a conduit between homeowners seeking trade persons and professionals looking for additional work.

Whether you're looking to get a job done or you're a trade person looking for additional work, Bidly is your go-to platform.

## Features
